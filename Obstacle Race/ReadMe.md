This folder contains my solution for assignment 2 of the course Advanced Machine Learning 2020 taught at CMI. 
The problem statement is that we are given a racetrack with obstacles and we have to train a RL agent to figure out how to navigate sucessfully across the track and reach the finish line.
Here, I use a Q-Learning algorithm to train the RL agent.
